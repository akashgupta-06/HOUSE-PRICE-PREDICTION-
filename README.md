# House Price Prediction with Flask Deployment
## Project Overview

- This project predicts house prices using supervised machine learning techniques and deploys the trained model as a web application using Flask.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask
- ML & Data: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Frontend: HTML, CSS

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Train-Test Split & Scaling
- Model Training (12 Regression Algorithms)
- Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R²)
 -Best Model Selection
- Flask API Development
 -Web UI Integration

## Web Application Features
- User input form for house features
- Real-time price prediction
- Clean and responsive UI

## Results
- Best R² Score: 0.91
- Robust linear models outperformed complex models on structured tabular data
